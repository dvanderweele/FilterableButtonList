# Fuzzy Searchable & Sortable Button List with Cyberpunk Aestheticâš¡

**A UI Automaton for displaying list of buttons:**

* powered by XState
* fuzzy searchable (via fuse.js)
* alphabetical and reverse alphabetical sort toggle button
* configurable delay after last text input in fuzzy filter before resort occurs (defaults to 500 ms)
* done data sent when exit button clicked or when one of the buttons in the list clicked; in latter case the name of the clicked button is included, and for exit button clicks empty object returned
* cyberpunk-aesthetic css just a coat of paint generated by ghostwriter

**Not:**
* virtually pageable (so just don't ask it to display way too many buttons)
